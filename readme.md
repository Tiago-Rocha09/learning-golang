# LEARNING GO

This is a simple system built using [**Golang**](https://go.dev/). I developed it following the mini-course from [**Net Ninjas**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gC88BEo9czgyS72A3doDeM)

My goal was to get the fundamental concepts of the language, including loops, types, core native packages, how to install, and declare variables, functions, interfaces, and how to execute simple software using Golang.

The mini-course thoroughly covers all these concepts, providing a clear overview of the language.
